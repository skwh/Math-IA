  \section{Introduction}
    Riemann Sums are a method of approximating the area underneath a curve by
    adding up the areas of shapes, usually rectangles, whose height is bound by
    a point on the function. As the width of these shapes approaches zero, the
    summation approaches the Riemann integral, the true area underneath the
    curve.

    \[ \displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x^*_i) \Delta x = \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx \]

    Riemann sums can be approximated three different ways, all of which depend on
    where the rectangle intercepts the curve. When the rectangle's top right
    vertex is bounded by the curve, this is known as a RRAM, or Right-hand
    Rectangular Approximation Method. The same goes for a left-bounded rectangle
     (LRAM), and a rectangle whose midpoint intercepts the curve (MRAM). The
    formula changes slightly for each method, denoted by \( x^*_i \). For LRAM,
    \( x_i^* = x_{i-1} \); RRAM, \( x_i^* = x_i \); and MRAM, \( x_i^* = \frac{1}{2}(x_i + x_{i-1}) \).

    Riemann sums are not limited to rectangles, however. Another, more accurate method of
    approximation makes use of trapezoids, whose area formula is comparably
    simple to that of a rectangle's. Trapezoidal approximation is similar to
    the result of averaging a left and right approximation. This method makes
    use of the trapezoid area formula \( A = \frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2) \). A Riemann
    sum constructed with trapezoids takes this form:

    \[ \displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{2}\Delta x\sum_{i=1}^n f(a+i\Delta x) \]

    Historically, Riemann's definition was the first rigourous definition of the
    integral of a function on an interval. Thus, in Calculus classes today, it is often
    the first introduction students recieve to the idea of calculating the area
    under a curve; the AP Calculus Syllabus even specifies Riemann sums as the
    first material in the Integrals unit.\footnote{http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-calculus-course-description.pdf}

    As a student who was introduced to integration with Riemann sums, I often
    wondered: are there other shapes that you could use or approximations similar
    to Riemann's that would behave similarly? In this paper I intend to
    investigate just that: are circles a viable shape to use in the fashion of
    a Riemann sum? How accurate is such an approximation? Does this approximation
    behave like a Riemann sum in that its limit approaches the real area under
    the curve?

    In this investigation, I'll derive this approximation (hereafter called the
     Circle sum) in a similar method to how Riemann sums can be derived.
    I'll then test each of my questions. I'll compare the efficacy of a Circle
    sum versus a similar Riemann sum, as well as examine the behavior of the Circle
    sum as it approaches infinity.

  \section{Derivation}
    The Riemann sum can be simply derived by finding the area of a rectangle under
    the curve, summing all such rectangles between two bounds, and finally taking
    the limit of this summation as the number of rectangles approaches infinity.
    In order to find a Circle sum, a similar process will be followed.

    \subsection{Riemann}
      We begin by being given a function \( f(x) \) and a set of bounds \( a \) and
      \( b \). The width of the workable area is defined as \( b-a \). Thus, we can
      divide the workable area into \( n \) partitions, each with a width of \( \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \).
      The right-bound x-value for any such rectangle inside of these bounds can be
      found by adding the partition width \( n \) times for the \(n\)th partition.
      Such a rectangle on the curve has width \( \Delta x \) and height
      \( f(a+n_i\Delta x) \). Thus, the area of this rectangle is \( f(a+n_i\Delta x)\Delta x \).
      This rectangle would appear below the function in the manner shown in Figure 2.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{riemann_deriv_1}
        \caption{A Riemann-style rectangle placed below a curve.}
      \end{figure}

      The sum of the rectangles that exist from \( a \) to \( b \) can be expressed
      with summation notation:

      \[ A_{total} = f(a+(0)\Delta x)\Delta x + f(a+(1)\Delta x)\Delta x + \dots + f(a+n\Delta x)\Delta x \]

      \[ = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n f(a+i\Delta x)\Delta x \]

      \( A_{total} \) is represented by the shaded green areas in Figure 3.

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{riemann_2}
        \caption{A function with Riemann rectangles placed underneath it.}
      \end{figure}

      When we take the limit of \( A_{total} \) as the number of partitions, \( n \),
      approaches infinity, we find that \( A_{total} \) approaches \( A_{real} \),
      given by integrating the function from \( a \) to \( b \).

      \[ \displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=0}^n f(a+i\Delta x)\Delta x = \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx \]

    \subsection{Circle}
      There are two concievable methods for using circles to determine the area
      underneath a function. The first stacks circles with radius \( n \) up to
      the curve, and sums their areas. This is shown in Figure 4. The second
      finds the largest possible circle which is tangential to the curve at a given
      x and sums the areas of the circles that do not overlap and which fit inside
      the bounds. This is shown in Figure 5.

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{circle_example_1}
        \caption{A stacked-circle style approximation.}
      \end{figure}

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{circle_example_2}
        \caption{A filled-circle style approximation.}
      \end{figure}

      \subsubsection{Filled Circles}
        Figure 5 somewhat gives away the failings of the Filled Circle method. Because
        circles cannot overlap, they cannot appropriatley grow to fit the area
        underneath the curve. This means that the approximation will have huge
        failings when it comes to estimating the real area underneath the curve.
        It also, by definition, fails to act like a Riemann sum in that it does not
        have a parameter which can be examined at infinity.

        The Filled Circle method will not be further examined here. Finding the
        optimal number of circles that will fit under the curve is a problem of
        \emph{circle packing}, which examines how to fit the optimal number of
        circles in an enclosed space.

      \subsubsection{Stacked Circles}
        This method is the most likely to behave like a Riemann sum because it creates
        smaller and smaller shapes to fit under the curve. However it might suffer
        in accuracy due to \emph{circle packing}. \emph{Circle packing} immediatley
        introduces a problem with computing a Riemann-style circle sum: a circle
        has approximatley 78\% the area of an optimally-sized square. It is to
        be discovered if this discrepancy will disappear as the number of circles
        increases to infinity.

        We can begin with the same set of givens for a Riemann sum: a function, \( f(x) \),
        and a set of bounds, \( a \) and \( b \). This workable area, with \( n \)
        partitions, has a partition width of \( \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \). In this
        case, each circle's diameter must equal \( \Delta x \). Thus the radius of
        each circle is \( \frac{\Delta x}{2} \).

        It is here that we run into some trouble with restricting the area of the
        circles. For circles to be bound between \( a \) and \( b \), they must
        all have the same diameter. If they all have the same diameter, they won't
        tangentially intercept the curve. However, if we adapt our estimation to
        create tangential intercepts for the circles, then the circles will spill
        over the boundaries created by \( a \) and \( b \). This problem is illustrated
        in Figure 6.

        Luckily, we can follow both paths and analyze which method gives us a more
        accurate estimate. The method which adheres to the bounds will be called
        the \emph{Strict Stacked Circle Method} (SSCM), and the method which adheres to
        the curve will be called the \emph{Loose Stacked Circle Method} (LSCM).

        \paragraph{Strict Stacked Circle Method}
          This paragraph will extol the virtues of the Strict Stacked Circle Method.
